Implement solver for Spider
-  Current implementation works but does not generate the
   optimal solution.  Currently, the first solution is returned
   immediately because continuing to search (even limited by
   the number of moves in a known solution) is prohibitively
   expensive.  There might be a better way to post-process the
   solution to get rid of unneeded moves, but I have not
   thought too much about it yet.  -- Feb 5, 2025

Test breadth-first search
-  We are already storing a bunch of state fingerprints to avoid
   repeated searches.  Perhaps storing an entire state is not that
   much more expensive.  Since breadth-first search would find the
   shortest solution first, we may even avoid some rabbit holes
   that lead nowhere.  -- Feb 11, 2025
   Unforuntately, the search queue grows up to a million states and
   just takes too long to run (at least in Firefox).  -- Feb 12, 2025
